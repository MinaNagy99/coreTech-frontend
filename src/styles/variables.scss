With a substantial local capacity we are able to retain the vast majority of the risks that we write, a sure comfort to many of our clients, especially at the time of claim - arguably the most important aspect of insurance - when they want to feel assured that the decision making process remains with the local company, which in turn facilitates a prompt settlement process.",
